# Savorly (PWA Prototype)

A demo recipe app built with **Materialize CSS** that showcases **Progressive Web App** features:
- Installable (manifest + service worker)
- Works offline (static asset caching + offline fallback)
- Responsive UI with Materialize components (nav, cards, forms, modals, selects)

## View the prototype
- GitHub Pages: <https://github.com/Achio-n/pwaRecipes/>

## Run locally
1. Serve the project with any static server (service workers require http(s)):
   - Python: `python -m http.server 8080`
   - Node: `npx serve`
2. Visit `http://localhost:8080`

## Tech
- Materialize CSS
- Vanilla JS
- PWA: `site.webmanifest`, `service-worker.js`
